My learning journey with Dataquest.io.

In this guided project I'm cleaning a CSV dataset and adding it to a SQLite database.

We'll work with data on Academy Award nominations, which can be downloaded here: https://www.aggdata.com/awards/oscar. 

The Academy Awards are : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards#Awards_of_Merit_categories

Here are the columns in the dataset, academy_awards.csv:

Year - the year of the awards ceremony.

Category - the category of award the nominee was nominated for.

Nominee - the person nominated for the award.

Additional Info - this column contains additional info like:

    the movie the nominee participated in.

    the character the nominee played (for acting awards).

Won? - this column contains either YES or NO depending on if the nominee won the award.
